# Deploying `explore.valve.city`

Handoff doc for whoever is wiring up the production deployment. The
trace repo (this one) builds the artifact; the deploy repo (Caddy +
host config on `valve-prod`) decides where it runs and how the world
reaches it.

## What we're deploying

A single Node 22 container built from `packages/api/Dockerfile`. The
image is **self-contained** — it ships both the compiled API and the
built web SPA, served from one Express process on port **10100**.

| Surface | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| API reference (Scalar UI) | `GET /docs` | HTML page bootstrapping Scalar against `/openapi.json` |
| OpenAPI 3.1 spec | `GET /openapi.json` | CORS-open (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`), `Cache-Control: max-age=300` |
| Etherscan-shaped dispatcher | `GET\|POST /api?module=…&action=…` | covers proxy + account + contract + tx + block modules |
| Legacy REST | `GET /api/tx/:hash`, `/api/address/…`, `/api/block/…`, `/api/source/…` | being phased out into the dispatcher above |
| Trace simulator | `POST /api/simulate*` | viem + Anvil fork backend |
| SPA | everything else | served from `packages/web/dist`, single-page React Router |

The OpenAPI doc is the public-facing piece. The SPA is the
human-facing UI. Both live in the same container; one reverse proxy
fronts the lot.

## Runtime requirements

- **Port:** 10100 (configurable via `PORT` env var).
- **Postgres:** required. The container reads `DATABASE_URL`; default
  is `postgres://valvetech:valvetech@localhost:5432/valvetech` which
  is local-dev only. Production needs a real connection string.
- **PulseChain RPC:** the container reads `PULSECHAIN_RPC_URL`;
  default is the public `https://rpc.pulsechain.com`. For production
  point this at the internal RPC fleet
  (`https://direct-a-evm-369.valve.city` or equivalent — see
  `rpc-fleet` infra).
- **Debug RPC (optional):** `DEBUG_RPC_URL` enables `debug_*`-method
  features (tracer, debugger). Falls back to `PULSECHAIN_RPC_URL` if
  unset; for production this should point at a debug-enabled node.
- **Blockscout API (optional):** `BLOCKSCOUT_API_URL` defaults to
  `https://api.scan.pulsechain.com/api`. Override if proxying through
  an internal cache.

`.env` is **not** baked into the image — pass env vars at container
run time (compose, systemd EnvironmentFile, Kubernetes env, whatever
the deploy host uses).

## Build & registry

The image is currently built locally via:

```bash
docker build -f packages/api/Dockerfile -t explore-api:latest .
```

The repo has **no CI deploy workflow**. Whoever owns the deploy repo
needs to decide:

1. **Where the image is built.** Options:
   - GitHub Actions in the trace repo, pushing to ghcr.io on every
     main merge (needs a CI workflow added).
   - In the deploy repo, pulling this repo as a submodule or via
     `git clone` + `docker build`.
   - Locally by an operator, pushed to a private registry.
2. **Where the image is pulled from.** Wherever the rest of the
   `*.valve.city` fleet pulls from. If nothing else exists,
   `ghcr.io/valve-tech/explore-api` is the natural slot.

## Where it runs

The container needs to be reachable from `valve-prod`'s Caddy
(88.99.192.187). Two viable shapes:

- **Co-located on valve-prod itself.** Container binds to
  `127.0.0.1:10100`; Caddy proxies localhost. Simplest, but couples
  Caddy reloads and the app's restart lifecycle to one box.
- **Separate app host.** Container runs on a dedicated host
  (`explore-app.valve.internal` or similar); Caddy proxies over the
  private network. Cleaner separation, requires another box.

Recommend co-located for v1 unless the rpc-fleet pattern (separate
`direct-*` boxes) is the established convention for app workloads
too.

## Caddy site block

Add to `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` on `valve-prod`. **Follow the valve
Caddy editing discipline** — the 2026-05-19 incident is why these
site blocks need careful review (no in-place edits without validate,
no `caddy reload --force`).

```caddyfile
explore.valve.city {
    # Reverse-proxy to wherever the container runs.
    # Replace with the actual upstream when known.
    reverse_proxy localhost:10100

    # The OpenAPI handler already sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    # on /openapi.json. Don't strip or override it — off-host docs
    # editors (incl. one.valve.city's federation viewer) need it.

    encode gzip zstd
    log {
        output file /var/log/caddy/explore.valve.city.log
        format json
    }
}
```

**Before reloading Caddy:**

1. `caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile` — must pass.
2. Diff the rendered config (`caddy adapt`) to confirm only the new
   site block changed.
3. Reload with `systemctl reload caddy`, **not** `caddy reload --force`.
4. Smoke-test from outside the box:

   ```bash
   curl -fsS https://explore.valve.city/openapi.json | head -c 200
   curl -fsS -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" https://explore.valve.city/docs
   ```

   Both should return 200.

## Federation registration

Per the OpenAPI commit (`2151ca2`), the federation pattern is:

```
one.valve.city/                   ← root manifest
  └─ services[0].docs.openapi     ← points at:
       explore.valve.city/openapi.json
```

To complete federation, the maintainer of `one.valve.city`'s manifest
needs to add the entry. That repo is separate from this one. Once the
Caddy block is live, send them this URL:

```
https://explore.valve.city/openapi.json
```

## Verification checklist

After Caddy reload, validate from outside `valve-prod`:

- [ ] `curl -fsS https://explore.valve.city/openapi.json | jq .info.title`
      returns `"valve · explore.valve.city"`.
- [ ] `curl -fsSI https://explore.valve.city/openapi.json | grep -i access-control-allow-origin`
      returns `*`.
- [ ] `https://explore.valve.city/docs` loads the Scalar UI in a
      browser, and the "Try it" tab can issue requests against the
      dispatcher.
- [ ] `curl -fsS "https://explore.valve.city/api?module=proxy&action=eth_blockNumber"`
      returns a non-zero block number, proving the RPC fleet is wired
      up correctly.
- [ ] The SPA loads at `https://explore.valve.city/` and is able to
      look up a block via the address bar.

## Rollback

The image is stateless aside from Postgres (which only holds
verified-source cache + future labels data, both regenerable).
Rollback is:

1. Revert the Caddy site block (remove the `explore.valve.city` entry
   or set it to return 503).
2. `systemctl reload caddy` after `caddy validate`.
3. Stop the container.

Postgres is left intact across rollbacks; no migration rollback is
required for this initial deploy because there are no destructive
migrations in the image.

## What the trace repo can do to support this

- Add a GitHub Actions workflow that builds + pushes the image on
  main merge — needs a registry target and credentials.
- Add a `compose.prod.yml` overlay if the deploy uses Docker Compose
  on the host.
- Add a healthcheck endpoint to the Express server if the deploy
  needs one (currently the container's only readiness signal is being
  port-bound).

Ping the trace repo owner with the deploy-repo path and the chosen
registry and they'll prep whichever of the above are useful.
