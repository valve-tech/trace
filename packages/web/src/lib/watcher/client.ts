/**
 * viem PublicClient factory for client-side watching.
 *
 * This is the bridge between the bring-your-own-RPC seam (`resolveRpcUrl`) and
 * viem's subscription primitives (`watchBlocks` / `watchEvent`). Every watcher
 * subscription resolves its endpoint here, so a user who has set a per-chain
 * RPC override in Settings watches on THEIR node — the polling load never hits
 * Explore's proxy.
 *
 * Clients are memoized per (chainId, resolved endpoint): viem keeps internal
 * polling/observer state, so handing the same client to multiple subscriptions
 * lets viem de-dupe the underlying `eth_blockNumber`/`eth_getLogs` polls. When
 * the user changes their override the resolved endpoint changes, the cache key
 * changes, and a fresh client is built — the stale one simply falls out of use.

 * (PulseChain, self-host chains) would just be ceremony. The default polling
 * interval (4s) is fine for an ambient, tab-open watcher.
