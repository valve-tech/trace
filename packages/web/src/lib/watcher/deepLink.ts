/**
 * Where clicking a fired watch should take you.
 *
 * A pure map from a `WatchMatch` to an in-app route path. Kept free of any
 * router/DOM concern so it's trivially unit-testable and so the same policy can
 * back both the desktop-notification click and (later) any other "open this
 * match" affordance. The caller hands the returned path to react-router's
 * `navigate`, which renders it correctly under both the BrowserRouter (`/tx/…`)
 * and HashRouter (`/#/tx/…`) builds — so this helper returns a plain path and
 * stays oblivious to the build mode.
 *
 * Returns a path string, never null: every match should lead somewhere useful.
