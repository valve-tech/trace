/**
 * OpenAPI spec ↔ live router drift gate for explore.valve.city.
 *
 * Walks the live Express app and asserts:
 *   1. every live route is either in spec.paths or explicitly allow-listed
 *   2. every spec path corresponds to a live route
 *   3. allow-listed routes still exist (no stale exemptions)
 *   4. every allow-list entry carries a reason
 *
 * Slice-1 allow-list: every /api/* route + the /ws/* / /rpc / /api/rpc
 * mounts. Each entry tags its follow-up tag commit so the rollout is
 * auditable as tag-by-tag coverage lands.
 *
 * Mirror of the monorepo's packages/api/src/openapi/drift.test.ts —
 * same shape, different repo's route inventory.
